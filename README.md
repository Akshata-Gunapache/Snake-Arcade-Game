# Snake-Arcade-Game🐍
 This is a classic snake game made by using **pygame** module of python.
 
 ## Modules Used🧩
 The game is primarily based off the pygame module of python to load images, display shapes, update screen, etc. Additional modules used to facilitate the usage of pygame are
 random, math and sys. It also uses **tkinter** that provides a simple way to create GUI elements using the widgets found in the Tk toolkit. 
 
 ## How To Play🎮
Guide the self-moving snake to food. When the snake eats it grows in length. Avoid fatal collisions with
border walls and the snake's own body.
1. Use left, right, up, down arrow keys to move the snake
2. The food will appear on the screen which on eating each time gives you 10 points.
3. There are two levels : Beginner and Pro
4. If you hit the ends of the screen or accidentally eat your own body, the game will be over.
Enjoy!
